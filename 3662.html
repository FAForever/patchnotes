                            <p>Welcome to the patchnotes for the 3662 patch.</p>
                            <p>This is the second part of the patch that has been tested since May, first by the tester team and later in 
                                the public beta by everyone. This latest version has again removed the HP changes, they're not tested 
                                enough. We've also delayed the Aeon ACU shield changes, Ythotha changes, and Billy changes. This list is 
                                the one that's being considered for release very soon.</p>
                            <p>The changes are now accessible through the FAF Beta featured mod. To help testing, please host and play games 
                                with the FAF Beta mod and post feedback on the balance forum!</p>
                            <p>These are the less controversial changes from the finished patch that will get released now. The more controversial
                                changes will be decided after a full community vote about the general direction and methods of balancing, and 
                                the balance councillor.</p>
                            <p>It contains a few bugfixes, some adjustments, additions and improvements to changes of the last patch, and new 
                                things like the Janus that finally gets some real love.</p>
                            <p>We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!</p>

                            <p>While the bomber changes of the first part can either be beneficial for Aeon players and their Auroras or not, the 
                                T2 nerfs were definitely welcome for them. To even this out a little bit, Aeon T1 MMA will now not survive a single 
                                bomb like the others, and tanks less damage in battle, but gets a small compensation in range.</p>

                            <p>The Janus bomber already saw significant improvements to its accuracy in the first part of the patch, but it wasn't 
                                the end of the process. This change completely re-works the bomber's firing cycle to ensure a large, even spread. The 
                                goal is to make it a more versatile and useful unit, while being different to the other t2 bombers. Where the other 
                                t2 bombers are most useful for taking out single targets, the role of the Janus will be taking out large armies with 
                                its AOE. It's almost impossible for all the bombs to hit one target, hence the higher overall damage.</p>

                                increasing cost, might change, but everyone who wished for a RAS nerf for a long time will hopefully be happy with this 
                                patch. Along with this, RAS SCUs become more expensive in power to make it a bit less easy to choose between them or

                            The visual effects for cloaked units from the BlackOps mod series have been added to the main game. You can see them at work when your Selen or Cybran ACU/sACU is cloaked!
