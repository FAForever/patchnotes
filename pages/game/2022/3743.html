            <h1>Game Patch 3743</h1>
            <p>There's an issue with tactical and strategic defenses not working when Nomads is enabled. This is due to changes to the base game done by patch 3741 that guarantees SMDs to function properly when there are multiple strategic missiles on top of each other. We can't revert this change without re-introducing the original bug that we're trying to fix.</p>

            <p>We've reported the issue and the solution to the maintainers of the mod.</p>

            <h3>Fix internal state of HQs</h3>
            <p>There was an issue with the internal state of the HQs, causing it to get corrupt. This was caused by a refactoring of patch 3741. If there are more issues with HQs then do report them on the forums or via Discord.</p>
