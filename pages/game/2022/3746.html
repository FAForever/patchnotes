            <h1>Game Patch 3746</h1>
            <p>I'd like to show my appreciation to those that made a friendly report on what was broken. We tackled the majority of the issues, with the exception of the resource button in the diplomacy tab. We disabled that for now.</p>

            <p>As an alternative you can also share resources via the scoreboard. The default scoreboard supports this too by ctrl / shift clicking on the resources of an ally. See also the tooltips.</p>
            
            <p>I was also informed that the author of Economy Manager released a patch, it is now compatible again. For those that use the range ring preview you can download a UI mod called 'Build Range Preview' made by Sheikah.</p>

            <p>With thanks to 4z0t and Sheikah for their help in writing this hotfix.</p>

            <p>
              With kind regards
              <br><br>

            <h3>Allow reclaim overview to be customizeable</h3>
            <p>You can now enable / disable batching via the game options. It is part of the interface section. You can also scale the text of the labels. Note that excessive scaling doesn't work properly with batching.</p>

            <p>It is highly recommended to enable batching for low-end systems.</p>

            <p>As part of a series of steps to remove shaders from the Nomads repository. We can't update our shaders unless we update theirs too. Instead, we now migrate the Nomads shaders into the base repository and remove the version in Nomads.</p>

            <p>This should fix graphics issues that people are experiencing.</p>
