            <h1>Game Patch 3741</h1>
            <p>Another month, another patch! With pride we present the next version of the game where we slowly start tackling long-standing issues that we've been taking for granted. Among them the tactical missile defenses that feel underwhelming, broken weapons such as those of the Galactic Colossus and beam weapons being unable to hit reliable. But soon no more - we're tackling them one by one!</p>

            <p>Not only that, from a development perspective we've made great strides. The amount of annotated code has exploded, allowing our extension to give proper suggestions and hints. Step by step, pull request by pull request we slowly turn the code base into one that supports modern programming features such as being able to jump to a definition and we now provide sane suggestions and snippets.</p>

            <p>We've reported the issue and the solution to the maintainers of the mod.</p>

            <p>With appreciation towards all the contributors that made this patch possible</p>

        <h2 id="bugs">Bug Fixes</h2>

        <div id="1">

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Re-implement game results</h3>
            <p>A complete re-implementation of how the game results are tracked. This should fix the famous draw bug (where one player wins and the other loses) and in general there should be less unknown game results.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix targeting bones of static shields</h3>
            <p>Should make them easier to hit with low-arc projectiles and beams</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix units being able to evade area damage</h3>
            <p>Due to how the game processes the game over several steps the area damage could be applied too late, allowing really fast units to already be out of the area of damage, even though the projectile had a direct impact. This is particularly noticeable for spy planes, where they are able to 'sustain' a lot of SAM fire while barely receiving a scratch in damage.</p>
            <p>All in all, this makes the game feel a lot more consistent. A hit should be a hit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix beam weapons being unable to hit all air units</h3>
            <p>Due to how the game processes beams there's a possibility that the beam aims 'in front' of the unit, causing it to miss. This is fixed by giving the unit (air units, for this change) a collision box (or sphere) that is of sufficient size. As a result, the Seraphim Lighting Tank (T3 MAA) no longer requires its hack, and because of that can no longer pierce shields :).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Remove problematic code of JSON library</h3>
            <p>Could occasionally cause a game crash</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Adjust collision hitboxes of all transports</h3>
            <p>Allows their cargo to receive (splash) damage more consistently and makes the transports easier to hit when they are landed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix target bones - Seraphim Land units</h3>
            <p>Similar to #4058 and #4063, makes these units easier and more consistent to hit when firing with beam weapons. We'll slowly tackle all of the units in the base game, but this is a consuming process!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Adjust collision box of Megalith due to build animation</h3>
            <p>Allows units to consistently hit the Megalith while it is being constructed</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Attempt at fixing a shield assist bug that could send all your resources into limbo</h3>
            <p>Particularly relevant for hives when they are assisting shields that are also taking damage</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Rowey fixing Jip</h3>
            <p>What would we be without him!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Attempt to fix the save / load functionality of the game</h3>
            <p>Long story short - we tried applying some tricks to improve performance a while ago and those did not work anymore after saving and then loading in the game. As a consequence, after loading the game was working with the wrong data causing all sorts of issues!</p>
            <p>We hope this fixes it, but if you still have issues with saving and loading then you can contact us via Discord or the forums.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Reduce projectile speed of air to air weapons</h3>
            <p>There's a collision bug that causes the game engine to pick the furthest collision if a projectile collides with multiple instances at the same time. As a consequence, it was difficult for interceptors to hit landed air units and in particular transports. By reducing the projectile speed (and increasing the size of the hitboxes with #4078) we try and solve this issue consistently for the base game</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix rare occasions when the statues quo of HQs are not updated properly</h3>
            <p>In particular, when gifting due to full share and when directly destroying the unit</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <ul>
              <li>Fix issue with single-item combo list</li>
              <li>Remove smoke ring on underwater SACU death</li>

        <div id="2">
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Re-implement the tractor beams of the Galactic Colossus</h3>
            <p>Re-implements the tractor beams of the Galactic Colossus from the ground up. They finally work as intended and can no longer remain stuck on invalid targets. Includes a slight boost to the effects, enjoy toying with the physics!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Add shooter cap to tactical missiles</h3>
            <p>Prevents the TMDs from overshooting their targets, as a result TMDs feel a lot more consistent and are in general a lot stronger.</p>
            <p>Fixes an issue with multiple SMDs being unable to stop multiple strategic missiles.</p>
            <p>Adds callbacks to units when their missile is intersected by a shield, a defense or by terrain.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Improved Mod Manager UI</h3>
            <p>Improves the mod manager by introducing a search bar, being able to mark mods as favorite and being able to sort mods on their type. Introduces the capability of interpreting URLs from the <code>mod_info.lua</code> file, allowing you to send people to a github, gitlab, bitbucket, sourceforge page or to a topic on the forums.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Allow jammers to recreate their jamming blips</h3>
            <p>Fixes the issue of jamming blips being gone forever once they were scouted. With this implementation, after fifteen seconds of being in the fog of war the jamming blips should re-emerge on their own.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Alternative CPU benchmark pt. 1</h3>
            <p>The first of two parts on creating a new CPU benchmark. The current benchmark tries to run some computations in the lobby. This has shown to be inaccurate. The new benchmark takes samples during the game and stores the highest possible sim rate you can run in combination with the total amount of units. Initial data points suggest that this is highly accurate and is even capable of detecting the throttling of laptops.</p>
            <p>The next part will replace implementation of the CPU score in the lobby. That will be part of the next release. This guarantees that everyone has some data to start off with.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Improve team color mode</h3>
            <p>Allows players to adjust the colors used in team color mode. With it, we can finally support people with color blindness.</p>
            <p>Players can choose their own colors by right clicking the team color mode button.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Introduce reclaim statistics for engineers</h3>
            <p>The game now keeps track of the reclaim statistics of engineers. They are shown where you'd usually see the veterancy of a unit. You can not see the statistics of allied units, just your own. Works for observers (and casters).</p>
            <p>This is the start of a new era where we'll be introducing statistics gradually. They help players with understanding the value of their actions - as an example, an engineer reclaiming trees on Seton's Clutch can quickly become responsible for hundreds (if not thousands) of additional mass.</p>

            <h3>Simplify base manager engineer patrol</h3>
            <p>When the patrol path was generated, there was a logic to move instead of patrol if the reclaiming was disabled on the base. That got removed since just moving engineers around does nothing. So it's either patrol or nothing.</p>

            <h3>Fix base manager rebuild counter</h3>
