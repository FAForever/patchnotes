            <h1>Game Patch 3626</h1>
            <p>The patch 3626 is now released. This patch is the result of months of work, and the first step of the “Next” project.</p>
            <p>A few months ago, a indiegogo campaign was launched to make Galactic War happening, but also bringing FA to the next step.</p>
            <p>This patch include lot of radical changes, new graphics, and overall a major step forward compared to previous patches.</p>
            <p>In order to ease the transition to “Next”, most of the featured mod will run patch 3625 until they are ready to make the transition. Here is the list of featured mod that will NOT take 3626 patch as a base version :
              <ul>
                <li>Nomads</li>
                <li>Blackops</li>
                <li>Diamond</li>
                <li>Supreme Destruction</li>
                <li>Xtreme Wars</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Nomads will be implemented as part of the Next project in a future patch. Others mods will need their author to be updated to Next.</p>
