        <div id="1">

          <div id="notify" class="card">
            <h3>Notify Features</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Notify started as a way to allow ACU upgrade progress to be communicated nicely to the team. FAF has taken it to the next level.</li>
              <li>Support for sending notifications about ACU upgrades, Factory Tech upgrades (HQs), Experimental construction, and Nuke and T3 Artillery construction</li>
              <li>By default, you will see notifications about ACU upgrades only, as well as an ETA overlay at the location of the upgrading ACUs</li>
              <li>Toggles available to define which types of messages you want to see come in from allies</li>
              <li>Notify messages limited to only show the first of each HQ type, Experimental (Non game-ender), Nuke, or T3 Artillery to avoid spamming the chat with notifications late-game</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="notify-ui" class="card">
            <h3>Notify UI</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Selecting your ACU will show any upgrades it has completed for each slot above the UI in the bottom left corner</li>
              <li>There is an in-game customisation menu UI. It can be accessed via the main menu, or with a key bind. Default binding is CTRL-ALT-F1</li>
              <li>Full customisation of all Notify messages is enabled, including resetting to default</li>
              <li>All message types are broadcast at all times. The menu allows you to customise which messages you see, using toggle buttons at the top of the customiser.</li>
              <li>Colour of Notify messages can be changed inside the chat window</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="upgrade-queuing" class="card">
            <h3>Upgrade Queuing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>ACU Upgrades can now be queued up the same as any other construction project</li>
              <li>Unfortunately, due to an engine limitation, upgrades cannot be UN-queued (You can only stop the ACU, cancelling the in-progress work orders)</li>
              <li>ACUs can queue buildings from an uncompleted tech level if the upgrade is queued</li>
              <li>Hotbuild has the ability to correctly access the uncompleted tech level buildings tooltip</li>
            </ul>

          </div>

          <div id="formations" class="card">
            <h3>Significantly Improved unit formations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Changed land and naval formations to give large units extra space instead of forcing the whole group to spread out</li>
              <li>Moved submarines so they sit between surface vessels instead of directly under them</li>
              <li>Changed air formation shape to spread units out more evenly and make large formations wider instead of a long line</li>
              <li>Made guard formation denser so more units can stay close to the target</li>
              <li>Changed shield distribution in guard formation to more efficiently cover the target and other guarding units</li>
              <li>Fixed several unit filter issues that caused units to get the wrong positions or even be excluded from a formation altogether</li>
              <li>Rearranged land and naval formations to give some units better positions</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="others" class="card">
            <h3>Other</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Blacklisted all previous Notify mod versions</li>
              <li>Improved spread attack. It now handles most order types.</li>
              <li>Changed the timeout on player attention pings to be per-player instead of on a global cooldown</li>
              <li>Fixed and optimised TML leading for AIs</li>
              <li>Increased the depth at which Megalith and Ythotha appear to be submerged in water instead of walking on land</li>
              <li>Reverted the Energy hotbuild cycling through to Storage, in response to popular demand.</li>
              <li>T3 Sonar can now be given assist commands. Primarily useful so they can guard a unit and stay with it.</li>
            </ul>
