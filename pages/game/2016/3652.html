            <h1>Game Patch 3675</h1>
          <hr>
        </div>

        <h2 id="lobby">Lobby</h2>
        <div id="1" class="card">
          <ul>
            <li>Name filter when selecting map</li>
            <li>Prevent host from changing player teams while he is ready</li>
            <li>Game quality in lobby now visible again</li>
            <li>Reduced auto-balance random variation to get team setups with better overall quality</li>
            <li>Default to score off</li>
            <li>Stopped the map filter preventing the map selected in prefs from prior games from showing</li>
            <li>Tiny fix to flag layout</li>
            <li>Fixed descriptions for the AIx Omni option and Lobby Preset button</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="ui">UI</h2>
        <div id="2" class="card">
          <ul>
            <li>Introduced Russian translations of many FAF additions to the game (Exotic_Retard and PerfectWay)</li>
            <li>Translate some FAF additions to Italian</li>
            <li>New key bindable action: 'soft_stop'</li>
            <li>Soft-stop will cancel all orders of a factory except their current one, if you soft-stop a factory with only one order it will get cleared</li>
            <li>Hold down Alt when giving a factory order to soft stop factory before issuing next order</li>
            <li>Multi-upgrade: Added UI support to upgrade structures several levels at once (i.e: cybran shields, hives, mexes, factories etc)</li>
            <li>Auto-overcharge: It's now possible to let overcharge fire automatically whenever you have the required power</li>
            <li>Order repair on a wreck to rebuild it if possible by some of the selected engineers. Those not able to rebuild the wreck will assist after the build starts.</li>
            <li>Units explicitly repairing (not assisting) a structure that dies will automatically try to rebuild it</li>
            <li>Refactor the income economy overlay not to show reclaim values appearing in the generated income column and do correct rounding of the numbers.</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with unit regen de-buff not being visible in UI</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with build power not visible in unit view</li>

            <li>Allow Hotbuild to find Support Factories</li>
            <li>Allow the UI code to search active mods for unit icons. Mods will have to have the icons in the right place (/modname/icons/units/xxx_icon.dds). Confirmed working for Total Mayhem at least, and probably many more.</li>
            <li>Show ren_networkstats in Connectivity Screen (F11)</li>
            <li>Show name of the one resuming a paused game</li>
            <li>Reverted the change to T1 PD icons from 3641, so now they don't give free intel on mouse-over when trying to fake PD-wall with all-wall radar ghosts.</li>
            <li>Render build range of engineers using native overlay system instead of decal hack</li>
            <li>Enabled Pause button in replays</li>

            <li>In Units Manager, separated some existing preset restrictions (e.g. game-enders, nukes) for better selection</li>

            <li>Increased TMD range by 1 and ROF by 0.2s to prevent a single TML killing a single TMD by using ground-fire to impact before the second TMD shot fires.</li>
