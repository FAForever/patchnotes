            <h3>Fix a bug where the command queue is stuck on a launch order.</h3>
            <p>This specifically occurred with the tech 3 strategic submarines and the tech 3 Seraphim battleship. As a result, the unit would be 'stuck' on the launch order, and any other order issued after the launch order would never be executed.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix a bug where distributed launch orders would not actually launch a missile.</h3>
            <p>This occurs when you issue launch orders and then distribute them. The new, distributed orders are processed and removed from the queue even though no missiles have been launched.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix a bug that cause gunships to have a tough time to hit certain units.</h3>
            <p>When a projectile experiences multiple collisions in a single tick, the engine does not always return the first collision. This issue frequently occurs with gunships, as they often fire from nearly vertical angles. Consequently, gunships can appear to 'hit' the terrain, even though they clearly hit the intended unit. To resolve this, we now ensure that every collision box of every unit has a minimum length of 0.5 ogrids.</p>

            <h3>Fix a bug that allows certain units to evade beams in specific conditions</h3>
            <p>Most notable the Brick no longer has the ability to evade beams.</p>
