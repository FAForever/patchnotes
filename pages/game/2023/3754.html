        <div class="Card">
          <p>We would like to remind people that there are various mods that provide different AI experiences. We can highly recommend you to download them from the vault and give them a spin.</p>

          <b>A short list of AIs we recommend at this point:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>M27: made by Maudlin</li>
            <li>RNGAI, as made by Relent0r</li>
            <li>Sorian Edit, as made by Marlo</li>
            <li>Uveso AI, as made by Uveso</li>
            <li>Dilli Dalli, as made by Softles</li>
            <li>Swarm AI, as made by Azraeel</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And not to forget the AI that ships with the Total Annihilation mod that is maintained by Dragun.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Fix base AI logic running with AIs from the vault</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 id="navmesh">Navigational mesh</h2>
        <div class="Card">
          <p>The navigational mesh is an abstract representation of a map. The AI can use that representation to gain an understanding of what the map 'looks like'. The navigational mesh is generated at the start of the map and works on any map.</p>

            <li>Fix labels being culled even though they have resources</li>
            <li>Introduce a search threshold when searching for a valid leaf</li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="pbr">Physics Based Rendering (PBR)</h2>
        <div class="Card">
          <p>We're slowly but surely preparing the game for a significant visual improvement. This is a long term project that is going to consume hundreds of hours.

If you have that interest and/or experience and you'd like to help out then you can introduce yourself in the dedicated channels in the official Discord channel!</p>
