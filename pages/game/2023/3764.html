            <h1>Patch 3763</h1>
            <h2>Date: June 27th 2023</h2>
            <p>See the patch notes of 3762 and 3758 for the full patch notes.</p>
            <p>There was a misconception with the distribution of files and as a result, wrecks would be removed in the release branch when you build on top of them. It was fun while it lasted ðŸ˜„</p>

            <h3>Enhancements to the unit restrictions menu</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Filters out dummy units</li>
              <li>Filters out insignificant units</li>
              <li>Fixes various bugs</li>

            <h3>Enhancements to the unit cheat menu</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Add unit count input</li>
              <li>Add faction logo to a unit</li>
              <li>Add tech level to a unit</li>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Allow tree groups to block a construction site</h3>
            <p>Based on player feedback, tree groups now obstruct construction sites and are therefore reclaimed by the engineers</p>
            <p>This is not to be confused with 'broken tree groups'. A tree group that is broken is split into individual trees. Once broken, these individual trees no longer block the construction site</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Additional hotkeys to unpause or pause all units</h3>
            <p>These new hotkeys allow you to express your intentions when (un)pausing a selection of units, especially when only a few of them need to be paused or unpaused</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Additional hotkeys to surface or submerge all units</h3>
            <p>These new hotkeys allow you to express your intentions when surfacing or submerging a selection of units, especially when only a few of them are submerged or surfaced</p>

        <h2 id="bugs">Bug Fixes</h2>

        <div id="2">

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Resolved the issue with the navigational mesh causing crashes during the save-load sequence</h3>
            <p>Most notable when playing the campaign alone. The navigational mesh was written as a large cycle. As a consequence, once the navigational mesh was generated the save process would be unable to serialize it and crash the game</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Fix the Ythotha storm discriminating allied units and patches of ground</h3>
            <p>There was a bug that would prevent the Ythotha storm from firing upon allied units. As a result, the storm would only deal damage to hostile units. Now, the storm treats all units and ground patches equally, inflicting damage without bias.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Prevent the intel recharge thread from hijacking the work progress bar</h3>
            <p>Most notable with the Cybran ACU once he has the stealth enhancement. This prevents the chaotic behavior when multiple Lua threads are trying to claim the progress bar</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Adjusted the positioning of tech 3 anti-air units in formations</h3>
            <p>The Bouncer and the Lightning tank have a direct fire weapon. As a result, they were considered to be a direct fire unit by the formations script. They are now recognized as anti-air units and therefore end up at the middle or the back of the formation like other anti-air units</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Remove the ability to cap Tech 3 air factories</h3>
            <p>The previous hotfix (3763) was unexpected and this change wasn't supposed to go live immediately. Regardless, we understood the feedback and are removing the behavior again</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>Sanitize the anti-surface threat value of ACUs</li>
              <li>Fix a bug where Seraphim torpedo bombers can trick torpedo defenses</li>
