            <ul>
              <li>Introduce a basic visualizer of the performance metrics that we gather as players play the game.</li>
              <li>Generate additional metadata when generating markers for AIs.</li>
              <li>Introduce a resource deposit grid for the AI.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This grid allows for computationally efficient lookups for the AI to scan the environment for resource deposits.</p>

            <h3>Beams that miss</h3>
            <p>We examined all tech 1 and tech 2 naval units and found that some had the ability to reliably evade beam weapons, with one particular submarine even doing so without moving.</p>
            <p>The Seraphim destroyer should now be able to reliably hit all tech 1 and tech 2 naval units with its beam weaponry.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Galactic Colossus can no longer evade beam weapons and should now be hit reliably, especially by the Spiderbot.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed units being able to miss the Galactic Colossus while it is being constructed.</li>
              <li>Fixed errors when an AI would be defeated.</li>
              <li>Fixed tree groups breaking when building structures.</li>
              <li>Quickly fixed an issue where coop had trouble understanding the mobile factories.</li>
              <li>Fixed the AI misinterpreting blank markers.</li>
