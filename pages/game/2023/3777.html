        <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
        <div id="1">

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Introduce a game option to adjust the minimum frame time.</h3>
            <p>This option allows you to align your framerate with the (high) refresh rate of monitors, potentially introducing tearing.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that the game is often CPU-bound rather than GPU-bound.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Refine the damage per second (DPS) calculations in the unit preview.</h3>
            <p>These calculations become visible only when the 'Display more unit stats' game option is enabled.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Extend repeat build toggle support to external factories.</h3>
            <p>You can now activate or deactivate the repeat build flag while having the mobile factory unit (e.g., the Fatboy) selected.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="bug">Bug Fixes</h2>
        <div id="2">

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix the wrong affinity mask being applied when a computer between 6 to 16 compute cores</h3>
            <p>This will noticeable impact the framerate of users.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix a bug that could make the build queue unresponsive.</h3>
            <p>A bug that was introduced two years ago. With thanks to the player named 'silentNoob' for his extensive efforts to try and document the bug.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Fix various bugs in the firing cycle of weapons.</h3>
            <p>Most notable: 
              <ul>
                <li>The UEF ACU no longer fires a second tactical missile at the same target when it has the full build suite.</li>
                <li>The Lightning tank, Bouncer and Cougar should no longer be able to rapid fire when giving target-changing orders (such as a stop order).</li>
                <li>The Spearhead now fires exactly once every 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Units that pack and unpack no longer pack or unpack twice in a row.</li>
                <li>Fix mobile factories showing an infinite build time.</li>
                <li>Fix the Seraphim tech 3 mobile artillery being unable to fire backwards.</li>
                <li>Fix for units that linger while being built and the mobile factory is destroyed.
                  <p>The lingering unit may not have been visible, but it does have gameplay impact. The lingering unit could for example block the placement for structures.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Fix the bug where the UEF Strategic Missile Submarine is able to fire multiple missiles in a single salvo.
                  <p>This could give the unit a negative missile silo count. The negative count would trigger all sorts of other bugs, such as the ability to launch missiles indefinitely.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Fix the formations of mobile land to air units.
                  <p>As a quick example, the Cybran Tech 1 MAA was considered a tank and would therefore always be at the front of the formation.</p>
                </li>
                  <li>Fix resources not being created on some generated maps.</li>
                  <li>Fix the Atlantis being unselectable while being built.</li>
                  <li>Fix projectiles that split being able to pierce shields.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <ul>
              <li>Fix shields warping across the map for 1/10th of a second as they are created.</li>
              <li>Various units are no longer able to evade beam weapons.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Improve the build animation of the Cybran naval factories.</h3>
            <p>The build arms are now animated and only extend as far as the size of the unit that they are building.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="Card">
            <ul>
              <li>Improve the charge and launch effects of the Yolona Oss.</li>
              <li>Match the water absorption of the terrain with the water absorption of units.</li>
              <li>Improve the water reflection of the sun.</li>

            <h3>Split the changelog across multiple files.</h3>
            <p>The original changelog file was so large it would almost turn into a singularity that would make generative AI blush.</p>

          <div class="Card">
            <h3>Allow the display of a build rate of 1.</h3>
