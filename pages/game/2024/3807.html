            <h3>Make veterancy requirements equal for presets and normal SACUs</h3>
            <p>Previously, the cost of enhancements for an SACU preset was added to the veterancy requirement of the unit, making it much harder to gain veterancy with them than manually upgraded SACUs.</p>

            <h3> Add custom 'foot fall textures' for the Ythotha</h3>
            <p>Previously the Ythotha would use the same texture that the ACU does, but scaled up. It now uses a custom made texture that better fits the shape. It's not perfect, if you're interested in improving it then do get in touch with us!</p>
