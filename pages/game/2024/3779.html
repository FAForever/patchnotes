        <div id="1">

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Reduce the maximum attack radius of the Aeon Tactical Missile Defense (TMD).</h3>
            <p>The Volcano could try to intercept missiles that it would never be able to. Given that TMDs try not to overshoot their target, the behavior would cause other TMDs to ignore the missile.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Fix a bug where the shared armies lobby option does not take into account random spawn positions.</h3>
            <p>As a result, the 'shared' armies would be scattered across the map.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">

              <li>Fix a bug for the AI where the threat-based pathing would return an incorrect result.</li>
              <li>Fix a bug for the AI where it would confuse the type of expansions, overspending significantly because of it.</li>
              <li>Fix the Shard being able to evade beams.</li>
              <li>Fix air units losing essentially all water vision once they have landed once.</li>
              <li>Fix a bug where the assist-to-upgrade feature would not pause the structure due to network lag.</li>
              <li>Fix a bug that would break achievement progression.</li>

            <p>Involves templates for the Soothsayer, the Eye of Rhianne, and the Salvation.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Add additional assist-to effects</h3>
            <p>You can now assist a tech 2 mass extractor with some adjacency to start an upgrade to tech 3.</p>
            <p>You can now assist a radar to start an upgrade. Requires some adjacency for a tech 2 radar.</p>
            <p>You can enable/disable the behavior at the 'Commands' header of the 'Gameplay' tab of the game options.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>Wrecks now warp back onto the map when units crash outside of the map</li>

            <h3>Show decimals of the build rate of units.</h3>
            <p>As an example, the build rate of a tech 3 engineer would previously show as '32' while it is actually '32.5'.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Add a silo hatch animation to the UEF ACU when it fires a missile.</h3>
            <p>There's a standard reload time that applies. This is most notable for the Billy. The hatch animation acts as a rough indication for this reload time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Rework the frames per second counter to update less frequently</h3>

          </div>

          <div class="card">
