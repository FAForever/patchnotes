            <h1>Patch 3765</h1>
            <h2>Date: June 27th 2023</h2>
            <p>The third developer's iteration contains more new features than any release in the past two years. It opens up new ways for players to approach the game.</p>
            <p>However, some features are being left behind. One of the most notable changes is the removal of the feature that allowed players to hover over a deposit to initiate the build mode for extractors or hydrocarbon plants. This feature was computationally expensive and is no longer part of the standard FAForever experience. However, it is still available as a UI mod for those willing to accept the performance penalty. You can find the 'Hover to Build' UI mod in the vault.</p>
            <p>Another feature with reduced functionality is the ringing feature. You can now only ring extractors with storages, while all other options are integrated into the new Context-Based Templates feature. You can read more about this in the features section. This change was made because the old ringing feature was computationally expensive and could cause stutters and frame drops for players. Therefore, it has been limited to its most commonly used functionality: the ability to ring extractors with storages.</p>
            <p>Lastly, any functionality that relied on the old spread attack implementation will no longer be operational. The previous implementation was susceptible to abuse and could even crash the game. We hope that the new implementation will better serve your needs as a player.</p>
            <p>With appreciation towards all the contributors that made this iteration possible.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/FAForever/fa/issues?q=label%3A%22feature%3A+mobile+factories%22">Mobile Factories</a></h3>
            <p>A long-standing functional myth has now become a part of the FAForever experience! All Tech 3 Aircraft Carriers, plus the Tempest, the Atlantis, and the Fatboy, can now build using a separate build module attached to the unit. The build module is located at the back of the unit. Clicking just over the back (on land/water) will select the build module. All factory hotkeys interact with these build modules.</p>
            <p>We're open to ideas from players on how we can further improve this feature, especially in terms of user interactions.</p>
            <p>The Megalith remains unchanged, while the CZAR temporarily loses its ability to build. We were unable to finalize it, but we hope to include it in a future patch.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/FAForever/fa/issues?q=label%3A%22feature%3A+distribute+orders%22">Advanced orders</a></h3>
            <p>We're enhancing existing advanced orders and introducing new ones. The most notable change is the complete reimplementation of the Spread Attack feature from the ground up. This wouldn't have been possible without the dedicated work of Strogo, RTD, and KionX.</p>
            <p>All of the mentioned orders are linked to hotkeys. In the key bindings menu, you'll find new world-wide-web icons next to hotkeys. If the world-wide-web icon is present, you can click on it to learn more about the hotkey on the FAForever wiki. We highly recommend checking out the Wiki; it even includes short videos that can explain concepts better than a thousand words ever could.</p>
            <p>The following hotkeys have been improved or added:

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/FAForever/fa/issues?q=label%3A%22area%3A+graphics%22">Advanced map shaders</a></h3>
            <p>We're excited to announce the introduction of advanced map shaders that map authors can now apply to their new maps. Existing maps will remain unchanged. These new shaders enable you to incorporate properties such as shadows, ambient occlusion, normals, and albedo textures directly into the terrain. This integration makes them an integral part of the rendering pipeline, rather than applying them on top of the terrain, as decals typically do.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/FAForever/fa/issues?q=+label%3A%22feature%3A+context-based+templates%22">Context based templates</a></h3>
            <p>An alternative use of the build templates system! With this new feature, you can cycle through build templates that adapt to the context of your selection and your mouse location. FAForever includes a set of default templates for this feature. The functionality is fully customizable, allowing you to remove existing templates or add your own to cycle through via UI mods.</p>
            <p>You can find the hotkey by searching for 'Context.' It defaults to 'Tab' for new players or those who have reset their keybindings.</p>

            <h3>We've improved CPU resource utilization to reduce frame stuttering for CPUs with 6 or more logical cores.</h3>
            <p>In practice, many CPUs have 6 or more logical cores. If we detect that your CPU has sufficient cores, we change the process affinity to ignore the first compute core. The first compute core is often used by processes, including the OS. When the game ignores the first compute core, the render thread (which is otherwise locked to the first compute core) has more room to operate and is less influenced by other processes and the OS. As a result, you'll experience fewer stutters and overall better frame times.</p>
