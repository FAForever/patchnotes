            <p>Fixes various issues that were introduced in the past game versions. The most notable issue is the bug where the fog of war is not removed when a game ends.</p>
            <p>With gratitude to all those who took the time to report issues,</p>
            <p>Jip</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h4>Fix a bug with capping extractors via the context-based templates feature</h4>
            <p>It was no longer possible to create the mass storage template for tech 2 or higher extractors with tech 1 engineers.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h4>Fix an exploit with the copy/distribute orders feature</h4>
            <p>The exploit was that a player could assign attack orders to (mobile) units that you lack any form of intel of as long as you control one unit that has an attack order that you can distribute and/or copy.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>Fix a bug where the map would not reveal at the end of the game.</li>
              <li>Fix Siren uselessly trying to repair units when assisting them.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="feature">Feature</h2>
        <div id="2">
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Add separate hotkeys to select all normal bombers and all torpedo bombers</h4>
            <p>They can be found in the Selection category of the hotkeys as "Select all Bombers (Normal)" and "Select all Bombers (Torpedo)".  Selecting normal bombers excludes the Mercy, as it is a kamikaze missile.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h4>Extend the context-based templates feature</h4>
            <p>The context-based templates feature generates and adjusts templates based on the context of your mouse. Globally speaking, this is one of two categories: 
              <ul>
                <li>(1) Mouse is over a unit or a build order</li>
              </ul>

              In this case the first template will always be the first buildable version of the unit that you're hovering over. Then additional templates may be introduced for common tasks, such as capping an extractor with storages.
            </p>
            <p>The first 'template' acts like a color picker - it enables you to copy the unit you're hovering over and build more of them.
              <ul>
                <li>Mouse is over a deposit, land or water</li>
              </ul>
              In this scenario you can easily create mass extractors, hydrocarbons and/or walled point defenses.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>Extend the context-based templates feature.</li>
              <li>Add a hotkey label for the Attack Move button.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

            <h4>Add Mercy to the BOMB category alongside Fire Beetle. Remove Loyalist from the category as its Charge ability was removed.</h4>
            <p>This allows category filtering to filter for Mercies.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>Simplify the setup for moderator events.</li>
              <li>Add missing categories to units with Anti-Torpedo defenses.</li>
              <li>Add missing categories to the CZAR</li>
              <li>Remove the BUILTBYEXPERIMENTALSUB category from all units that previously had it. As this category was unused, the Tempest still functions as you would expect.</li>
              <li>Remove the MASSFABRICATION category from all ACUs, SACUs and the Paragon. Add the ANTIMISSILE category to the Seraphim Aircraft Carrier.</li>
              <li>Remove the ANTIMISSILE category from the Brick as it does not have torpedo defenses</li>
            </ul>
