        <div id="1" class="card">
          <ul>
            <li>Caching interface files to remove UI-lag, especially when selecting builders.</li>
            <li>Adding an icon if a player is Dead in Connectivity and Disconnect windows.</li>
            <li>Add Auto-Kick after 3 minutes on Disconnect dialog.</li>
            <li>Adding a new button on the menu to hide/show all settings of this game.</li>
            <li>You can now make game presets.</li>
            <li>Add new unit restrictions : TELEPORT, BILLY, ENGISTATION, SALVATION, MAVOR, SCATHIS, PARAGON, SATELLITE.</li>
            <li>Several speedup in the lobby (connections attempt are now multi-threaded).</li>
            <li>Fixed “Faction not set” when moving from Observer to Player.</li>
            <li>Fixed the possibility to move an Observer to Player with the Observer Button.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 id="feature">Feature</h2>
        <div id="2" class="card">
          <ul>
            <li>SCU presets with already upgraded SCUs buildable from Quantum Gateways (The costs of the upgrades are added to the cost of the SCU base).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="bugs">Bug Fixes and Small Tweeks</h2>
        <div id="3" class="card">
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed an exploit that allowed to duplicate infinite amount of buildings for free (Drag & dropping when rebuilding from a wreck).</li>
            <li>Cybran T2 and T3 Engineers HP fixed.</li>
            <li>Fireball explosion is now red instead of green.</li>
            <li>Cybran SMD BuildTime fixed.</li>
            <li>Czar central target bone removed to reduce the likelihood of ASFs flying right through the beam and being roasted.</li>
            <li>Czar beam weapon has a 75% Damage reduction against ASFs so they are not insta-killed any more when they do fly right through the beam.</li>
            <li>UEF TMD Projectiles fixed. They were dying too soon to kill Tactical Missiles launched from ACUs – Weapon Unpacks = false (From true).</li>
            <li>Several Beam weapons – Small improvements from ShadowKnight’s mod (Not all) to make them deal damage more “Smoothly” and change targets more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Sera T2 Point Defense – 550 damage (From 660) due to beam weapon changes amounting to a buff (137.5 DPS from 165, but will sweep through several units until it deals its full 550 Damage meaning less overkill).</li>
            <li>Tempest MuzzleVelocity reverted to 28 to prevent it to shoot over small targets like mass extractors.</li>
            <li>Firebeetle TurnRate increased to 160 (From 120) and TurnRadius increased to 4 (From 3) for a small handling improvement.</li>
            <li>Rover BuildRadius = 8 to fix an issue where it would not finish the buildings it started to build.</li>
            <li>ASFs can’t shoot Rovers (Prevents them being used to kill Shields and Base Structures late game VS UEF). Special 75% resistance to Czar beam.</li>
            <li>ASF Projectiles Aeon and Seraphim now shoot 1 projectile instead of 3, and have FiringTolerance = 2 (Don’t need to line up totally to fire, the same as the others). Cybran shoots 2 instead of 4. DPS is unchanged (This greatly lowers lag caused by large ASF battles).</li>
            <li>ASF HP changed because the projectile adjustments impacted balance. This corrects it again. UEF = 1800 (From 1850). Cybran = 1725 (From 1700). Seraphim = 1775 (From 1800)</li>
            <li>Seraphim ASF TargetCheckInterval adjusted to 0.5 (From 0.3).</li>
            <li>Seraphim T2 Artillery PitchRange = 90 (From 80) to fix it not being able to fire to maximum range.</li>
            <li>Cybran Strategic Missile Submarine Stealth now hides it from Sonar too.</li>
            <li>Better animations for walking bots – Mongoose, Titan, Brick, Aeon Sniperbot, Percival.</li>
            <li>Out of fuel speed penalty reduced to 65% from 75% to increase the possibility of reaching Air Staging when far away (Also, T1 Bombers won’t drop two times on the same target due to too low speed).</li>
            <li>Cybran T2 Air Support Factory no longer has a weird colour when zoomed out.</li>
            <li>T2 and T3 Engineer price reduction. T2 = 140 Mass/700 Energy/700 BuildTime (From 160/840/800). T3 = 440 Mass/2200 Energy/2200 BuildTime (From 490/3150/2100).</li>
            <li>Seraphim Air Factory overall Engineer production rate reduced via rolloff time (It is still faster than the original but not crazy fast any more, speed similar to Aeon). They already have the best Bomber and have Fobo on water maps, they don’t need to have better Air Factory too.</li>
            <li>T1 Bomber drop chance increased – TurnSpeed and CombatTurnSpeed = 0.75, 0.8 for UEF (From 0.7). LiftFactor = 10 (From 7).</li>
            <li>Bombers targeting a wreck are no longer permanently prevented from firing (By Brute51).</li>
            <li>Janus won’t scorch the earth any more when bombing a Shield.</li>
            <li>Sparky added to Air and Naval factories.</li>
            <li>Teleport has brand new visual and audio effects (By Brute 51).</li>
            <li>Teleportation now deals only 100 Damage to nearby Units and Structures in a small radius (Doesn’t kill T1 Engineers any more).</li>
            <li>Shield Stacking Damage overflow and transfer refactored (By Brute51) to prevent Resonance Effect (First Shields hit no longer take more Damages than the Damage dealt by the weapon in the first place). Overlapping Damage dealt = 15%.</li>
            <li>Cybran build drone bug/exploit fixed (By Brute51).</li>
            <li>DifferentialUpgradeCostCalculation = true, in units/ZAB9602/ZAB9602_unit.bp</li>
